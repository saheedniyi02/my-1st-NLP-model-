My first NLP model using scikit-learn's CountVectorizer and Logistic Regression

<h4> Data</h4>
The data was gotten from Zindi's covid 19 tweet classification challenge.

<h4>Model Objective:</h4>
 The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post is about COVID-19 or not. This model will help gather tweet data about the epidemic without relying only on key words like ‘covid’ or ‘coronavirus’ being present, allowing researchers and engineers to gather a more comprehensive dataset for sentiment analysis.
